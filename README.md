## Web Customer Frontend

This is the application that houses the Citi Square Customer Frontend.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

- You need docker installed.

### Running in docker

```bash
npm run docker:bash
# or
yarn docker:bash
```

### Running locally

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
# or
yarn && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Making Changes

After you make changes and stage them to git, it runs a pre-commit check to ensure proper code formatting and enforce code styling.

If the check fails, you will need to reformat the code with e.g

```bash
npm run format
# or
yarn format
```

Once it is successful, the commit then becomes successful.
